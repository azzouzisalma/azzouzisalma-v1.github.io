Welcome to my about page.           
:wave:

This website will give you an overview of my academic and professional career, as well as some of my interests. And you will also find some articles about different topics.

I am a Telecommunication engineering student in 2nd year at ENSEIRB-MATMECA school, Talence, France.

My educational background can be described to be **excellent** and **challenging** at the same time which contributed significantly in the process of building my personality  and acquiring a variety of skills.

I had my baccalaureate in Mathematical Sciences in 2018 with an Honours degree at the **Moulay Driss high school**, Fes, Morocco.
After months of preparation, I was selected to integrate **Lydex (high school of excellence) preparatory classes** in Benguerir. During these two years, I studied intensively Maths, physics, chemistry and engineering sciences.
In 2020, I went to  [ENSEIRB-MATMECA](https://enseirb-matmeca.bordeaux-inp.fr/fr/enseirb-matmeca-presentation) where I’m still studying Telecommunication in my 2nd year now.

# Hobbies and main interests

I am so passionate about **Mathematiques**. So I have been participating in  **math olympiads** since I was 14 years old. :symbols:

I am also interested in entrepreneurship, I have developped my entrepreneurial mindset during a national competition [**Injaz Al-Maghrib**](https://injaz-morocco.org/). In 2017 and during a year, we were setting up a junior company to develop and create an automatic and programmable watering system. Here is a picture of our team the day of the competetion.

I also love sharing my passion about sciences generally and mathematics particularly. So, I have been working as a tutor in my school and with the company [**complétude**](https://www.completude.com/). I have accompanied students of different levels (high school, college, university...) in their preparation for exams.

I’m so passionate about aerospace :rocket::satellite_orbital: , neuroscience :brain:, and learning new languages 📚. So, I have been participating with the school association **eirb'space**  in different project and also the association
